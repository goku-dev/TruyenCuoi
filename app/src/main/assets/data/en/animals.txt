The Other Side
 
Once upon a time there was a river. The Nile River to be exact. On one side of the river lived the rabbit and on the other side lived the bear.    One fine day the bear was sitting on a stump enjoying his breakfest of berries. Then he heard someone yelling at him. It was the rabbit.     
''Hey! Hey, Teddy, get your butt over here. I've got something to show you!''    
''Not now! I'm eating.''     
''Oh come on!'' said the rabbit. ''It's really important.''     
''No way.''     
''Please. It's urgent.''     
So the bear decided to go all the way over the wide river.  It took him all day and all night to get over to the other side. He nearly drowned. And when he finally got there he was groaning and panting, and wheezing for air.      
''Well, rabbit,'' he panted. ''What did you want to tell me?''      
''Hey, Teddy,'' the rabbit began, ''look how many berries are on the other side of the river.''

An elderly lady phoned her telephone company
 
 
An elderly lady phoned her telephone company to report that her telephone failed to ring when her friends called - and that on the few occasions when it did ring her pet dog always moaned right before the phone rang. The telephone repairman proceeded to the scene curious to see this psychic dog or senile elderly lady. 
He climbed a nearby telephone pole, hooked in his test set, and dialed the subscriber's house. The phone didn't ring right away, but then the dog moaned loudly and the telephone began to ring. 
Climbing down from the pole, the telephone repairman found: 
1. The dog was tied to the telephone system's ground wire via a steel chain and collar. 
 2. The wire connection to the ground rod was loose.
 3. The dog was receiving 90 volts of signaling current when the phone number was called.
 4. After a couple of such jolts, the dog would start moaning and then urinate on himself and the ground.
 5. The wet ground would complete the circuit, thus causing the phone to ring.
  
Which demonstrates that some problems CAN be fixed by pissing and moaning.

                              One day, the Presbyterian Church called a meeting to decide what to do about the squirrels. After much prayer and consideration they determined that the squirrels were predestined to be there and they shouldn't interfere with God's divine will. 
         In the Baptist Church the squirrels had taken up habitation in the baptistery. The deacons met and decided to put a cover on the baptistery and drown the squirrels in it. The squirrels escaped somehow and there were twice as many there the next week.  
         The Methodist Church got together and decided that they were not in a position to harm any of God's creation. So, they humanely trapped the Squirrels and set them free a few miles outside of town. Three days later, the squirrels were back.  
         But -- The Catholic Church came up with the best and most effective solution. They baptized the squirrels and registered them as members of the church. Now they only see them on Christmas and Easter.

Wizard of Toad
 
There once was a toad that was excluded from all Green Toad activities because he was a handsome shade of yellow. So he went to visit a beautiful fairy in the town over who had the power to grant wishes. 
  Fairy,   he said.   I would like to be green, so I can play with all the other toads.   
  Granted!   said the fairy, who turned him yellow. Unfortunately, his little toady penis was still yellow.  
  What about my penis?   he asked the fairy.  
  Oh! For that, you'll have to go see the wizard.   And so the toad hopped off to find the wizard. Soon, a pink elephant visited the fairy, and he wished to be turned gray. She granted him the wish, but, as with the toad, his penis was still pink. So she told him to visit the wizard. 
  How do I find the wizard?   he asked. 
  Just follow the yellow d**k toad.

Rocket Science
 
Scientists at NASA have developed a gun built specifically to launch dead chickens at the windshields of airliners military jets and the space shuttle all traveling at maximum velocity. 
The idea is to simulate the frequent incidents of collisions with airborne fowl to test the strength of the windshields. 
British engineers heard about the gun and were eager to test it on the windshield of their new high speed trains.   Arrangements were made.  But when the gun was fired, the engineers stood shocked as the chicken hurtled out of the barrel, crashed into the shatterproof shield, smashed it to smithereens, crashed through the control console, snapped the engineer's backrest in two and embedded itself in the back wall of the cabin.  
Horrified Britons sent NASA the disastrous results of the experiment, along with the designs of the windshield, and begged the U.S. scientists for suggestions. 
NASA's response was just three words,   Thaw the chicken.

 The owl replies,   I always sleep at night and am awake during the day. I am an owl and we usually are awake during the night.

The next night, a cat comes in. He says,   I always sleep during the day. Like my friends, I want to sleep during the night. Can you help?   
 The psychologist advises the cat to come back in one day, as he is very busy.    The next day, the cat comes very, very, very early for his appointment and ends up at the same time as the owl. The cat is told to wait outside. He peeks in the owl's appointment and figures out his problem... and his address!   
During the next evening, when the owl usually comes in for his appointment, the cat comes in. The psychologist asks the cat why he is here instead of the owl.

And it was so.Then God created the dog, and told him,   You will hold vigilance over the dwellings of Man, to whom you will be his greatest companion. You will eat his table scraps and live for 25 years.   
 
  And the dog responded,   Lord, to live 25 years as a dog like that is too much.Please, no more than 10 years.   And it was so.God then created themonkey, and told him,   You are monkey.  You shall swing from tree to tree,acting like an idiot. You will be funny, and you shall live for 20 years.

Finally, God created Manand told him,   You are Man, the only rational being that walks the earth. Youwill use your intelligence to have mastery over the creatures of the world. You willdominate the earth and live for 20 years.

And it was so. And so God made Man to live 20 years as a man, then marry and live 20 years like a mule working and carrying heavy loads on his back.

Sons Devoted to Mom
 
Three sons left home to make their fortunes and they all did very very well for themselves. They got together recently and were discussing what they each had done to benefit their aging mother. 
  Well,   said the first one,   I bought Mom a huge house in Beverly Hills.   
  I bought her a Mercedes and hired a full-time driver for her.   
  I've got you both beat,   said the third.   I bought her a miraculous parrot that can recite any Bible verse you tell it to.   
A little later, the mother sent out a thank you letter to all three sons.   Gerald -- the house you bought was too big. I only live in one room, but I have to clean the entire house. Milton -- the car is useless because I don't go anywhere because I'm too old. But Robert -- you know exactly what I like. The chicken was delicious.

Turtles and Picnics and a Minor Tragedy
 
Three  turtles Joe Steve and Poncho decide to   go on a picnic.  Joe packs the picnic basket   with cookies bottled sodas and sandwiches. The trouble is the picnic site is 10 miles away so the turtles take 10 whole days to get there.   
By the time they do arrive, everyone's whipped and hungry. Joe takes the stuff out of the basket, one by one. He takes out the sodas and realizes that they forgot to bring a bottle opener.   Joe &amp; Steve beg Poncho to turn back home   and retrieve it, but Poncho flatly refuses,   knowing that they'll eat everything by the time he gets back.   
Somehow, after about two hours, the turtles manage to convince Poncho to go, swearing on their great-grand turtles' graves that they won't touch the food.    So, Poncho sets off down the road, slow and   steady.   
Twenty days pass, but no Poncho.  Joe   and Steve are hungry and puzzled, but a promise is a promise.  Another day passes, and still no   Poncho, but a promise is a promise.  After three   more days pass without Poncho in sight, Steve   starts getting restless.    I NEED FOOD!   he says   with a hint of dementia in his voice.     
  NO!   Joe retorts.    We promised.     
Five more days pass.  Joe realizes that Poncho   probably skipped out to the Burger King down the   road, so the two turtles weakly lift the lid, get   a sandwich, and open their mouths to eat.  But   then, right at that instant, Poncho pops out   behind a rock.  
  Just for that, I'm not   going.

The Funky Parrot
 
A woman had a parrot that she took with her everywhere she went.  She would even take the parrot to the club with her when she went dancing and drinking on Saturday nights.  
Whenever the woman went onto the dance floor, the parrot would yell,   The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire, we don't need no water-let the muthafukkah burn! Burn, muthafukkah, burn!       
The crowd on the dance floor would always cheer and holler in appreciation when the parrot would yell. This would make the parrot yell even more and of course make the crowd go wild. This would go on all night long, every time the parrot went out.     
One Sunday morning the woman took the parrot to church and into the choir section with her, and when the choir started to sing, the parrot yelled, ''The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire, we don't need no water-let the muthafukkah burn! Burn, muthafukkah, burn!''     
She was horrified and corrected the parrot,   No, you don't say that here!      
The parrot looked around and asked,   Why not? These are the same muthafukkahs that was at the club last  night!

The Smartest Dog Ever
 
As a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop he sees $10 and a note in his mouth reading:   10 lamb chops please.      
Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth, and quickly closes the shop. He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and trot across the road to a bus stop. The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench. When a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus.  The butcher follows, dumbstruck. 
As the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery.  After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the   stop   button, then the butcher follows him off. 
The dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the stoop.  He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door.  He does this again and again. No answer.  So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window, jumps off, and waits at the front door.   A big guy opens it and starts cursing and pummeling the dog.   
The butcher runs up screams at the guy:   What the hell are you doing?  This dog's a genius!   
The owner responds,   Genius, my ass.  It's the second time this week he's forgotten his key!

Walking in a Doggie 
 
To the tune of   Walking in a Winter Wonderland  :
 
 Dog tags ring are you listening'?
 In the lane snow is glistening.
 It's yellow not white -- I've been there tonight
 Marking up my winter wonderland.
 Smell that tree? That's my fragrance.
 It's a sign for wandering vagrants;
   Avoid where I pee it's my property.
 Marked up as my winter wonderland.  
 In the meadow dad will build a snowman
 following the classical design.
 Then I'll lift my leg and let it go man
 So all the world will know it's mine-mine-mine!
 Straight from me to the fence post
 flows my natural incense boast
   Stay off of my turf this small piece of earth
 I mark it as my winter wonderland.
