Royal Wedding
 
On the day of the Royal Wedding Sofia was getting dressed surrounded by all her family and she suddenly realized she had forgotten to get any shoes. Then her sister remembered that she had a pair of white shoes from her wedding so she lent them to Sofia for the day. Unfortunately they were a bit too small and by the time the festivities were over Sofia's feet were in agony. When she and Edward withdrew to their room the only thing she could think of was getting her shoes off. The rest of the Royal Family crowded round the door to the bedroom and they heard roughly what they expected grunts straining noises and the occasional muffled scream. Eventually they heard Edward say ''God that was tight.'' 
''There,'' whispered the Queen. ''I told you she was a virgin.'' 
Then, to their surprise, they heard Edward say. ''Right. Now for the other one.'' Followed by more grunting and straining and at last Edward said ''My God. That was even tighter.''

Two Guys on a Golf Course
 
Two guys are hitting the links at their local golf and country club. Luckily it's a beautiful day and there's  hardly anyone on the course so they've been breezing through the holes. Up around the seventh tee they  spot the first people on the course other than themselves two ladies who from the guys' perspective are having trouble on the green. In fact they've each five-putted it!       
The first guy says ''Christ. I hope they just had a bad hole, I don't want to follow these broads for the next eleven holes!'' The second one goes, ''Well, maybe I'll go talk to them, and maybe they can let us pass them. I'll be back in a sec.''      
So he trots off, about to go and ask to let them pass. Suddenly, about a hundred feet away from the women,  he stops, turns and runs away from them as fast as he can. When he comes back, he exclaims, ''Jesus! That's my  wife and my girlfriend! They're both here! Golfing together! I'm sorry, man, but I can't say anything to them. I'm  liable to be killed if they saw me. How about you go ask them?''      
So the other guy concurs, and trots off to ask the women if they can pass and get on with their game. Then he stops suddenly, spins around and runs back  to his buddy in the same manner.     ''What's wrong? What's the matter?'' his friend says.    ''Same damn thing,'' he replies.

The Golfer's Confession
 
A man goes to the confessional.   Forgive me father for I have sinned.   
  What is your sin, my child?   The priest asks back. 
  Well,   the man starts,   I used some horrible language this week and feel absolutely terrible.   
  When did you do use this awful language?   said the priest. 
  I was golfing and hit an incredible drive that looked like it was going to go over 250 yards, but it struck a phone line that was hanging over the fairway and fell straight down to the ground after going only about 100 yards.   
  Is that when you swore?   
  No, Father.   Said the man. 
  After that, a squirrel ran out of the bushes and grabbed my ball in his mouth and began to run away.   
Is THAT when you swore?   asked the Father again. 
  Well, no.   said the man,   You see, as the squirrel was running, an eagle came down out of the sky, grabbed the squirrel in his talons and began to fly away!   
  Is THAT when you swore?   asked the amazed Priest. 
  No, not yet.   The man replied.   As the eagle carried the squirrel away in his claws, it flew  towards the green. And as it passed over a bit of forest near the green, the squirrel dropped my ball.   
  Did you swear THEN?   asked the now impatient Priest. 
  No, because as the ball fell it struck a tree, bounced through some bushes, careened off a big rock, and rolled through a sand trap onto the green and stopped within six inches of the hole.   
  You missed the f**king putt, didn't you?   sighed the Priest.

You Bet Your (Sex) Life, 
A golfer is in a competitive match with a friend, who is ahead by a couple of strokes.  The golfer says to
himself,   I'd give anything to sink this next putt.  
 
A stranger walks up to him and whispers,   Would you give up a fourth of  your sex life?   
 
The golfer thinks the man is crazy and that his answer will be meaningless, but also that perhaps this is a good omen, so he says,   Okay,   and sinks the putt. 
 
Two holes later he mumbles to himself,   Boy, if I could only get an eagle on this hole.   
 
The same stranger moves to his side and says,   Would it be worth another fourth of your sex life?   
 
The golfer shrugs and says,   Sure.   
 
He makes an eagle.
 
On the final hole, the golfer needs yet another eagle to win.

Though he says nothing, the stranger moves to his side and says,   Would you be willing to give up the rest of your sex life to win this match?   

The golfer says,   Certainly!    He makes the eagle.
 
As the golfer walks to the club house, the stranger walks alongside and says,   You know, I've really not been fair with you because you don't know who I am. I'm the devil, and from now on you will have no sex life.   
 
  Nice to meet you,   says the golfer.   My name's Father O'Malley.
